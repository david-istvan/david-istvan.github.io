## Rationale

Collaboration is often seen as an enabling technique and a tool-related aspect in MDE. Yet, collaborative modeling has typically been addressed at the foundations level, and the empirical evaluation of tools has been lacking. We are proposing an innovative workshop format to fill this gap. The workshop brings together collaborative tool developers with an actively involved audience, who will test and evaluate the tools during hands-on sessions. The results will be further analyzed briefly after the workshop, and reported in an  organized  format. The timing of the workshop is especially appropriate. The online format of the 2021 edition of MoDELS provides a rare opportunity to study the dynamics of collaborative modeling endeavors in a realistic environment, with physically distanced stakeholders forced to rely on the means of collaboration provided by the tools under study.

## Theme and goals

- Real-time synchronous means of collaboration
- Asynchronous means of collaboration
- (In)consistency management
- Advanced conflict visualization and resolution techniques
- Data-level collaborative techniques
- Domain-specific collaborative solutions
- Informal means of collaboration
- Semantic techniques (versioning, visualization, etc.)
- Human factors in collaboration


## Format

This is a full-day workshop, with two distinct parts: the morning session with talks and presentations; and the afternoon session with the hands-on experimentation. Tool developers are invited to support the experiments with their tools by providing a supervisory presence, and preferably a brief tutorial before an experiment commences. Participants are invited and encouraged to experiment with multiple tools in the afternoon; and are asked to subsequently evaluate their experience. No prior knowledge is required for the afternoon session; the talks of the morning session, and the brief tutorials in the afternoon will provide sufficient information to enable working with the tools. The workshop is fully on-line. The hands-on experiments will be conducted in Zoom breakout rooms.

I. Morning session: Presentations. Lightning talks, vision paper presenta-
tions, case paper presentations; and a Q&A session after each talk. All talks will

be recorded and published on the workshopâ€™s website.
II. Afternoon session: Hands-on sessions.
The participants will be invited to experiment with the tools of their choice.
They will perform collaborative modeling activities previously assembled by the
organizers, based on the submitted case papers.
Format. Zoom breakout rooms will be used to carry out the collaborative tasks.
The room will be supervised by a person with extended expertise on the specific
tool. Tool providers will be asked to delegate one or two people to support the
work with their tools; to fill in any gaps, graduate students knowledgeable with
the tools may be invited by the organizing team.
Before the hands-on activities. The supervisor will briefly present the tool
(building on the tool presentation during the morning session) and the modeling
task.

During the hands-on activities. As participants perform the modeling ac-
tivities, they can interact with the supervisor, should they encounter technical

difficulties, or ambiguities in the task description. The activities in each room

will be recorded, and the participants will be asked to consent before the record-
ing starts. The supervisor will extract metadata, such as time to perform certain

tasks or the number of technical issues experienced, and summarize the session.
The rooms will be openly accessible, and the audience can visit and observe
them, though interactions are not permitted. Depending on the specificities of
the tool under test, we may opt for constraining all means of collaboration to

only what the tool offers, prohibiting other means of collaboration and commu-
nication.

After the hands-on activities. The participants will be asked to fill in a
debrief form for evaluation purposes. The organizers will prepare the sheets in

advance, based on [4,5]. These sheets will assess various functional and extra-
functional aspects of the tools, such as the ease of use, perceived efficiency, etc.

The workshop participants can experiment with other tools, after they have
finished an activity and have filled in the debrief form.
