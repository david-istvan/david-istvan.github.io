## Rationale

The ability to collaboratively engineer models of systems has become a particularly important topic in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). Apart from becoming multidisciplinary, engineering teams are also getting more and more distributed in space and time. The lack of physical presence forces engineers to rely on digital means of collaboration. Given the recent trends in the research and development of collaborative MDE tools, it is high time for their hands-on evaluation.

The rare opportunity, provided by the online format of the 2021 edition of MoDELS, enables studying the dynamics of collaborative modeling endeavors in a realistic environment: with physically distanced participants forced to rely on means of collaboration provided by the tools under study.

## Who is this workshop for?

This workshop primarily aims to bring together two groups of the collaborative MDE landscape. <i>Tool builders</i>, who are wishing to evaluate their tools in a highly realistic setting; and the current or potential <i>users</i> of collaborative MDE tools in general. These two groups share the common goal of carrying out experiments within a properly established and controlled environment. Tool builders might also find this workshop a good opportunity for creating publicity for their tools.

This workshop is also open to researchers and practitioners with innovative ideas regarding collaborative MDE. To this end, we invite two types of papers.

## Format

This is a full-day workshop, with two distinct parts: the morning session with talks and presentations; and the afternoon session with the hands-on experimentation. Tool developers are invited to support the experiments with their tools by providing a supervisory presence, and preferably a brief tutorial before an experiment commences. Participants are invited and encouraged to experiment with multiple tools in the afternoon; and are asked to subsequently evaluate their experience. No prior knowledge is required for the afternoon session; the talks of the morning session, and the brief tutorials in the afternoon will provide sufficient information to enable working with the tools. The workshop is fully on-line. The hands-on experiments will be conducted in Zoom breakout rooms.

<b>I. Morning session: Presentations.</b> Lightning talks, vision paper presentations, case paper presentations; and a Q&A session after each talk. All talks will be recorded and published on the workshopâ€™s website.

<b>II. Afternoon session: Hands-on experiments.</b> The participants will be invited to experiment with the tools of their choice. They will perform collaborative modeling activities previously assembled by the organizers, based on the submitted case papers. After each experiment, participants will be asked to evaluate the tools by filling in the previously assembled evaluation sheets.
