<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

The ability to collaboratively engineer models of systems has become a particularly important topic in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). Apart from becoming multidisciplinary, engineering teams are also getting more and more distributed in space and time. The lack of physical presence forces engineers to rely on digital means of collaboration. Given the recent trends in the research and development of collaborative MDE tools, it is high time for their hands-on evaluation.<br/><br/>

This workshop aims to bring together developers of collaborative MDE tools, and the extended modeling community, in order to enable the evaluation of these tools by hands-on experimentation. The results of the evaluations will be used for assessing the maturity and the challenges of the domain.<br/><br/>

The workshop intends to leverage a rare opportunity provided by the online format of the 2021 edition of MoDELS. The online format enables studying the dynamics of collaborative modeling endeavors in a realistic environment, with the physically distanced participants forced to rely on the means of collaboration provided by the tools under study.<br/><br/>

<h2>Topics of interest</h2>

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
    <li>Real-time synchronous means of collaboration</li>
    <li>Asynchronous means of collaboration</li>
    <li>(In)consistency management</li>
    <li>Advanced conflict visualization and resolution techniques</li>
    <li>Data-level collaborative techniques</li>
    <li>Domain-specific collaborative solutions</li>
    <li>Informal means of collaboration</li>
    <li>Semantic techniques (versioning, visualization, etc.)</li>
    <li>Human factors in collaboration</li>
</ul>


<h2>Submissions</h2>
We invite the following three types of submissions.<br/><br/>

<b>Case papers</b> (up to 10 pages) elaborating on a collaborative case, and demonstrating its solution via a tool of choice. The description of the case should include a general challenge, and an example scenario of that challenge. Authors of the accepted papers will be invited to give a talk during the morning session; and their tools will be used during the afternoon session. The submitted cases will be used by the organizers to construct the modeling tasks of the afternoon session.<br/>
<b>Vision papers</b> (5 pages) and <b>Extended abstracts</b> (1 page) presenting innovative ideas. Authors of the accepted vision papers will be invited to give a regular talk. Authors of the accepted extended abstracts will be invited for a lightning talk.<br/><br/>


All papers are to be prepared in the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE double-column</a> format, and submitted via EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=howcom2021">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=howcom2021</a>.<br/>
All submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee. Authors of case papers should expect a particularly detailed feedback in order to allow them to leverage the opportunity the workshop provides to the fullest.<br/><br/>

<h2>Case paper specific instructions</h2>
<i>TBA</i><br/><br/><br/>

<h2>Publishing</h2>
Case papers and vision papers will be published in the MoDELS Companion proceedings. Extended abstracts will not be published. Every accepted paper will be available on the workshopâ€™s website prior to the start of the workshop.





Papers submitted to MDE Intelligence 2021 must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MDE intelligence 2021. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy (as stated explicity by the IEEE on https://www.comsoc.org/publications/ieee-communications-society-policy-plagiarism-and-multiple-submissions) will be deemed as a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases.
