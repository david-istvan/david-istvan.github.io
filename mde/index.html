<h2 style="background-color: #EEEEEE">Topic group #1: Design of DSLs with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/">Xtext</a> and <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/">Sirius</a></h2>
<p align=justify>Domain-specific languages (DSL) are integral parts of nowadays' engineering practice. As opposed to elaborate and generic-purpose modeling languages (such as the UML), DSLs are tailored to a specific problem of a specific domain. Due to this narrow scope, newly arising problems require development of new DSLs and that, in a rapid and eficient way.<br />
By choosing one of these topics, you will have the opportunity to get acquainted with the fundamentals of DSL design, and more specifically: design of textual DSLs with Xtext and design of visual DSLs with Sirius.</p>

<h2 style="background-color: #EEEEEE">Topic group #3: Application of ontologies</h2>
<p align=justify>System modeling is a prevailing paradigm in nowadays' engineering. Even though tool providers offer mature and seasoned modeling tools, the actual modeling process is still a challenge, because it requires a good understanding of the problem and its context, something often referred as domain knowledge. Ontologies are a formal system for modeling domain knowledge. Much like in standard modeling languages (such as UML class diagrams), knowledge is captured by using types types, properties, and interrelationships of the entities. Ontologies are typically used to infer new knowledge from known domain facts; and for identifying contradictions, i.e. flaws in the knowledge base. As an emerging technique in systems engineering, ontologies are expected to become integralpart of the next generation of engineering/modeling tools.

By choosig one of these topics, you will have the opportunity to get acquainted with the fundamentals of ontology-based modeling.</p>

<h2 style="background-color: #EEEEEE">Topic group #4: SAT solving, constraint programming</h2>
<p align=justify>Imperative algorithms are not always the most appropriate techniques to tackle certain engineering problems. Consraint solvers and boolean satifiabiality solvers provide a viable alternative where the solution to a problem is not defined in terms of executable steps (as in standard programming), but rather in terms of constraints that have to be satisfied. A dedicated solver then attempts to satisfy the system of constraints to come up with a set of solutions. <br/>
By choosig one of these topics, you will have the opportunity to get acquainted with state-of-the-art SAT solvers within the context of MDE problems.
