# Program

This is a full-day, fully online workshop, with two distinct parts.

<b>I. Morning session: Presentations.</b> Lightning talks, vision paper presentations, case paper presentations; and a Q&A session after each talk. All talks will be recorded and published on the workshopâ€™s website.

*Accepted papers & detailed program TBA*.


<b>II. Afternoon session: Hands-on experimentation.</b> The participants will be invited to experiment with the tools of their choice. Tool developers are invited to support the experiments with their tools by providing a supervisory presence, and preferably a brief tutorial before an experiment commences. Participants are invited and encouraged to experiment with multiple tools in the afternoon; and are asked to subsequently evaluate their experience. No prior knowledge is required for the afternoon session; the talks of the morning session, and the brief tutorials in the afternoon will provide sufficient information to enable working with the tools. The experiments will be conducted in Zoom breakout rooms.
