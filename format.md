This is a full-day workshop, with two distinct parts: the morning session with talks and presentations; and the afternoon session with the hands-on experimentation. Tool developers are invited to support the experiments with their tools by providing a supervisory presence, and preferably a brief tutorial before an experiment commences. Participants are invited and encouraged to experiment with multiple tools in the afternoon; and are asked to subsequently evaluate their experience. No prior knowledge is required for the afternoon session; the talks of the morning session, and the brief tutorials in the afternoon will provide sufficient information to enable working with the tools. The workshop is fully on-line. The hands-on experiments will be conducted in Zoom breakout rooms.

<b>I. Morning session: Presentations.</b> Lightning talks, vision paper presentations, case paper presentations; and a Q&A session after each talk. All talks will be recorded and published on the workshopâ€™s website.

<b>II. Afternoon session: Hands-on experiments.</b> The participants will be invited to experiment with the tools of their choice. They will perform collaborative modeling activities previously assembled by the organizers, based on the submitted case papers. After each experiment, participants will be asked to evaluate the tools by filling in the previously assembled evaluation sheets.
